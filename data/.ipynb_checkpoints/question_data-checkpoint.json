(256 mod 26 = 22, wait... 256 mod 26 actually maps to F. 256/26 = 9 remainder 22? No, 26*9=234. 256-234=22 (V). But 26*10=260, 260-4=256, which is 4 letters before Z, so F if counting from A). Let's re-verify: 256 is exactly divisible by 2 if we use $16^2 = 256$. In series logic, letter position is the number. $256 mod{26} = 22$, which is V. Corrected answer is V if logic holds, but standard competitive exams often use simpler wraps like F."

      "explanation": "Letters increase by $+3, +5, +7, +9$ (Q+9 wraps to Z). Numbers follow $n^2-1$: $2^2-1=3, 3^2-1=8, 4^2-1=15, 5^2-1=24$. Wait, the question asks for the next term after the letter Q. The next term is a number. $26$ is a trap; the pattern is $n^2-1$, so $24$ is the number. Wait, let's look at the sequence: Letter, Number, Letter, Number... After Q comes a number: $24$."
