    {
        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "Rajesh's mother's only sister is Rajesh's aunt. The man introduced as her brother would therefore be Rajesh's uncle. Thus, the correct relation is 'Uncle,' making option A the intended answer, but since the question asks for how the man is related to Rajesh and not vice versa, and given the options provided, the closest match is 'Cousin' if considering direct blood relatives of the same generation, hence B."
    },
    {
        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "Rahul describes himself as the son of his father's only sister. This means the person he is describing is his aunt\u2019s child, making them Rahul\u2019s cousin."
    },
    {
        "answer": "D",
        "reasoning": "The pattern follows groups of three letters followed by a number. Each group starts with the next set of three consecutive letters in the alphabet, and the number increments by 1 for each subsequent group. The correct continuation after JKL4 should be MNO5."
    },
    {
        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "Rahul states he is the son of his father's only sibling, meaning this sibling is his uncle or aunt. Therefore, Rahul's cousin is the child of his uncle or aunt. Hence, Rahul's cousin is indeed his cousin, not brother, nephew, or uncle."
    },
    {
        "answer": "B",
        "reasoning": "From Statement I, since all books are pens, it directly implies that some books are pens (Conclusion II). However, Statement II does not provide any direct link between pencils and books, thus Conclusion I cannot be inferred."
