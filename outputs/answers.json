Conclusion II proposes some birds are dogs, which also lacks support. Thus, neither conclusion logically follows."

        "answer": "C",
        "reasoning": "A is second from the left, so the first position must be occupied by someone else. Since C is at one end, and given A's position, C must be on the far left. B is immediately to the right of A, placing them in positions 2 and 3 respectively. With D not next to B, D cannot be in position 4. Therefore, E must be in position 4, leaving D for position 5. Thus, C is third from the left."
