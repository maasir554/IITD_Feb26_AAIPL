        "reasoning": "Rajesh states that he is the son of his father's only sibling. This means the person he is referring to is his father's sibling's child, making them cousins. Therefore, the correct relation is 'Cousin'."

        "answer": "D",
        "reasoning": "Statement I implies there's overlap between dogs and cats but doesn't confirm any specific relationship for all members. Statement II links all cats to birds. Statement III indicates some birds are fish. Conclusion I suggests some fish are cats, which isn't supported since we can't infer this reverse relationship. Conclusion II proposes some birds are dogs, which also lacks support. Thus, neither conclusion logically follows."

    {
        "answer": "C",
        "reasoning": "A is second from the left, so the first position must be occupied by someone else. Since C is at one end, and given A's position, C must be on the far left. B is immediately to the right of A, placing them in positions 2 and 3 respectively. With D not next to B, D cannot be in position 4. Therefore, E must be in position 4, leaving D for position 5. Thus, C is third from the left."

    },
    {
        "answer": "A",
        "reasoning": "From Statement I, since all cats are dogs, and Statement II says no dog is a bird, it logically follows that no cat can be a bird. However, Statement III does not provide any direct link between fish and dogs, so Conclusion II cannot be inferred. Therefore, only Conclusion I follows."

        "reasoning": "Initially, A sits next to B but not C, and D sits next to both C and E. This implies the initial arrangement could be C-D-E-B-A or A-B-E-D-C. After swapping B and E, the arrangement becomes A-E-D-B-C or C-D-E-A-B. In both cases, C is between A and D."

        "answer": "A",
        "reasoning": "Statement I suggests some overlap between cats and dogs but does not imply all cats are dogs. Statement II confirms dogs are mammals. Conclusion I logically follows since if some cats are dogs and all dogs are mammals, then some mammals must be cats. However, Conclusion II cannot be inferred directly from the given statements."
