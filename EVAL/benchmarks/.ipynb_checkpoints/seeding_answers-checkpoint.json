C sits next to both B and D, implying BCD or DCB together. With D third to the left of someone at an end, if we place D next to C and B, and fit them into the remaining spots, C must sit between B and D. Thus, C and D are next to B."

C sits next to B and D, implying they form a trio. With D's third-left position being at an end, if D is at 7, the sequence could be G-A-E-F-C-B-D.
