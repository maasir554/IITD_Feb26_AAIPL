    "  * Before the matchups begin, there will be an **elimination round** where we will test your A-Agent against a hidden set of questions. The teams' A-Agents that scores the highest on these seeding questions will move onto the elimination stage. \n",
    "* Like in cricket, each match has two innings:\n",
    "    -   1st inning:\n",
    "        *   $N$ Question from the Q-agent (Team-A) and their corresponding $N$ answers from the A-agent (Team-B).\n",
    "        *   Q-agent score (Team-A): Say, $40$\n",
    "        *   A-agent score (Team-B): $60$\n",

    "    -   2nd inning:\n",
